              to note that funds in an FSA do not roll over, so it’s advisable

          Invisalign treatment is generally not painful. Patients may experience
          some discomfort or pressure when transitioning to a new set of
          aligners, which is normal and indicates that the treatment is working.

          The duration of Invisalign treatment varies depending on individual
          needs and treatment plans. On average, treatment can last between 12
          and 18 months, but this timeline may be shorter or longer based on the
          complexity of the case.

          Unlike traditional braces, Invisalign aligners are removable, allowing
          patients to eat and drink comfortably without restrictions. However,
          it’s essential to remove the aligners before consuming anything other
          than water to prevent damage or staining.

        </h2>
        <p id="description4" class="description">
          For optimal results, aligners should be worn for 20 to 22 hours per
          day, removing them only for eating, drinking, brushing, and flossing.
          Consistently wearing aligners as prescribed ensures effective
          treatment progress.

        <p id="description5" class="description">
          Invisalign is suitable for treating a wide range of orthodontic
          issues, including mild to moderate cases of misalignment, crowding,
          gaps, overbites, and underbites. However, severe cases may require
          alternative treatment options.
